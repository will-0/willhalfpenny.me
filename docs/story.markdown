# Story

This page is career gocus I'd briefly explain how I ended up in this dual medicine/engineering space, both as context for the website and as information for those looking to do something similar.

### 1. Medicine Undergraduate (University Years 1 & 2)

At 18, I started studying Medicine at the University of Cambridge. Whilst I enjoyed the University, I was not totally enamoured by the course. It was insteresting, but I was missing the feeling of deep understanding that I got from studying Physics and Maths at school.

At the end of my first year, I started enquiring about moving courses.

### 2. Engineering Undergraduate (University Years 3 & 4)

I was fortunate enough that Cambridge was a flexible place and, after enquiry, I discovered it was permitted for medics to join the Engineering program. A small cohort of us joined the third year of the course.

### Clinical Medicine (University years 5, 6 & 7) -->
