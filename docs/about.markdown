Welcome! My name is Will, and the purpose of this website is to start hosting some of my thoughts, documenting some of my projects, and generally 'build in public'.

## Why have I made this?

I've never been particularly adept at using social media, having often seen more of the negatives than the positives. However, in recent years, I have been inspired by many examples of the online community using social media in a productive way, for connecting across boundaries and sharing knowledge.

Whilst I will occasionally share projects on here, it is mainly a forum for thought and learning. For myself, these posts will act as an exercise in the [Feynman technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), and in improving my much-neglected English writing skills. Hopefully they may also be helpful and/or insightful to others.

## Topics

I anticipate that these posts will most cover topics in computer, data and cognitive sciences. However, I am famously eclectic (read: distractable) in my interests, so no promises! It will often be things that I am learning at that moment in time.

## Commenting and feedback

I am yet to set up a mechanism for this, but if you would like to get in touch please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willhalfpenny/).

Thanks!
