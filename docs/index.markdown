Welcome, thanks for visiting the website! My name is Will, I'm an doctor and an engineer.

## What do I do?

By day, I work at Chelsea and Westminster hospital as an FY1 (first-year resident). On the side, I explore the world of knowledge, data and communication. You can read more about this in my [blog](/blog).

## What field am I interested in?

As above, I'm currently interested in how we can acquire, represent, transform and use data. I discuss these topics in my [blog posts](/blog). However, I've previously explored several areas, and have worked on brain-machine interfaces, machine learning and observational research. I'm also interested in startups, having helped found (Synapcard)[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/synapcard/cimngaoenacpjfodphiokngpleelamei?hl=en-GB&pli=1] and [Finomics](https://finomics.app).

## What am I currently working on?

My current main focus is a startup project called [Finomics](https://finomics.app), an assistant for healthcare workers. I'm building this with [Laz Ranasinghe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lasith-ranasinghe/).

## How can I get in touch?

I'm always happy to have people reach out. You can get in touch by emailing me at [hello@willhalfpenny.me](mailto:hello@willhalfpenny.me), or by reaching out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willhalfpenny/).
