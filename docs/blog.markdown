# Blog

This topics explored by this blog mainly fall under the umbrella of information engineering. Some of the core questions here are:

* How do we represent information?
* Which information is important?
* How do we ingest different representations?

## Key Ideas

The following list is *meant* to be imperfect, as it tracks with the progression of my knowledge. However, as it currently stands, here are the things I think are key insights for tackling the above questions:

* Relevant core theory will come from [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) and [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory).
* Spatial information is important
* Meaning is derived from data + context (see [this post](/2024/08/23/role-of-context.html))

I would be *very* grateful to be criticised on this approach. Please feel free to reach out to me at [hello@willhalfpenny.me](mailto:hello@willhalfpenny.me)

We also make the assumption that the information we care about is [declarative knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_knowledge).
