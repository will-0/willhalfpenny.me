# Blog

This topics explored by this blog mainly fall under the umbrella of information engineering. Some of the core questions here are:

* How do we represent information?
* Which information is important?
* How do we ingest different representations?

## Key Ideas

As with everything on this site, my 'key ideas' will likely change but here's how they currently stand:

* The core avenues are understanding data are linguistics (specifically, of declarative sentences) and information theory (encoding)
* 

I would be *very* grateful to be criticised on this approach. Please feel free to reach out to me at

We also make the assumption that the information we care about is [declarative knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_knowledge).
